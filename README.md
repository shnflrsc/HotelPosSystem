# HotelPosSystem
This is a terminal-based barebones Hotel Point-Of-Sale System, my first dive into Object-Oriented Programming. It introduced me to a lot of programming concepts that I realize I should've studied first before diving in. But learning by doing is best.


### What I Learned ðŸ“‹
- **Software Architecture**
  - Learned the existence of common design patterns
  - Structured the application using Model-View-Controller
- **Object-Oriented Design**
  - Modeled entities like `MenuItem`, `Order`, and `OrderItem` into classes
  - Practiced encapsulation, immutability, and composition
- **Design Principles**
  - Built a layered app structure (`Model`, `Repository`, `Service`, `Controller`, `View`)
  - Passed responsibilities to correct layer
  - Followed **Separation of Concerns**
- **JDBC & Database Access**
  - Learned how to write basic SQL statements
  - Wrote code that connects JDBC to an SQLite3 Database
- **Relational Database Design**
  - Designed database schemas with primary and foreign keys
- **Error Handling & Exception Flow**
  - Used `try`, `catch`, and `throws` for error handling
  - Throws exceptions up the chain, so only the Controller handles exceptions
- **Developer Thinking**
  - Got humbled, learned that planning data flow beforehand matters
  - Lots of redesigning, refactoring, and debugging
